Set Up:
Given to Implement:

- Supermarket:
	+ 6 cash registers available (*1):
		- 5 regular cash registers 
                - 1 combined cash register/service desk: 
		  	2 queues (*2):    + regular customers

																								      + service desk customers(priority)
						
	+ Arriving customers :			
	         - queue up by checking number customers in line at each of the cash registers(shortest queue)
		 - service desk customers (e.g. cigarettes, lottery, stamps, etc.) can only line up for the service desk. 
														
						
- Customers :
	+ Regular arrival:              
                 - Poisson process at a rate of 1 per minute.
		 - Service times: normally distributed with mean 2.6 minutes and a standard deviation of 1.1 minutes, 
                                  where the smallest service time is 1 second.
						
	+ Service desk  arrival:         
                - Poisson process with mean interarrival time 5 minutes
		- Service times: a normally distributed  of on average 4.1 minutes and a standard deviation of 1.1 minutes, 
		                 where again the minimum service time is 1 second. 
                                                       
- Rules to consider during implementation:

	   (*1) - Service desk always open
		- Minimum two additional cash registers are
		- if registers(queue length)=> 4 => open one more < max cash registers
		- if register is empty => close it  (be pragmatic)
						
	   (*2) - Total queue length :	- Service desk return the sum of the lengths of both queues.
						
(Implement this setting in java, using the engine provided and modifying it where necessary, but donâ€™t start making large modifications and optimizations.) 

- Output:
	+ Measures of interest are the mean delay of customers:
		- Mean delay of regular customers 
		- Mean delay for service desk customers 
		- Overall delay
		- Average queue length
	+ Provide for these four measures a 95% t-confidence interval
						
            
            (Goal Summary)

            1- Generate values from java simulation
            2- Export organized data table to matlab data file format
            3- Run statistics over data in matlab.
            
            (To consider):  
						
            (!) Do proper statistics, all assumptions of such confidence interval are satisfied.
		(The statistical analysis can be performed in Matlab.)
						
	    (!) (Ultimate goal) For PR reasons : estimate a maximum delay and a maximum queue length that can be guaranteed 95% of the time for each type of customer.
